        <h3 class="subHeading">User Research</h3>
        <p>Back 2 School is a new product so I needed to understand the potential users more so that I know more about their frustrations and expectations then curate a product that suits them best. I decide to conduct user surveys using google forms and send them out to parents with children still going to school</p>
        <p>These are the questions asked:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Do you want your kids to go to a public or private school?</li>
          <li>Did the school meet your expectations?</li>
          <li>What are some common thinking styles parents demonstrate when making a school choice?</li>
          <li>How much time do parents typically spend researching different schools? How many schools do they consider before making a choice?</li>
          <li>What would parents change about the school choice process?</li>
        </ol>
