        <p>I was the only user researcher in this project. I had to figure out the pain points, the delights and the characteristics of our potential users which were parents and kids who were 9-13 years old. I also needed to go through existing products that were offering financial literacy to kids and find out wht can be improved.</p>

        <h3 class="subHeading">What is 'In the Bag'?</h3>
        <p>Building Early Money Habits in Kids. In the Bag is a digital platform that provides age based, interactive money lessons for children 10 -12 years old (5th and 6th grade). It is a 5 week interactive live course taught online via Zoom where children learn about personal finance.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <h3 class="subHeading">Background</h3>
        <p>According to Forbes, 50% of children surveyed wish their parents taught them more about money. Children are not equipped with financial literacy and yet they are magically expected to be good at managing money when they are adults. They end up wasting money getting into debt which eventually affects their mental health and other aspects of their life.
        In the bag is a digital platform that will provide children with financial management resources that make break down the concepts to be easy to understand and fun to learn</p>

        <h4>Primary Research</h4>
        <p>Conducted surveys online usig google forms.</p>
        <p>The were three groups of participants for the interviews and surveys: parents, teachers and the 9-12 years children.</p> 
        <p>I conducted an online survey with the parent’s where aia sent a google form survey to them to answer at their own time.</p>
        <p>I administered user interviews via a voice call with an elementary teacher to understand how to effectively pass information to kids of that age.</p>
        <p>I conducted user interviews with 2 children, one 9 year old and a 13 year old to understand their process of internalizing information.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="content">
        <h4>Secondary Research</h4>

        <h3 class="subHeading">Insights</h3>
        <p >Savings and budgeting are the most important topics parents want their children to learn.</p>
        <p>The classes should be interactive and include games and videos as their main medium of teaching the children because most children learn using visuals and touch.</p>
        <p>Parents lack support on financial management platforms for their children. All they can do is view their kids progress.</p>
        <p>Children at that age require to be encouraged and reassured frequently because they can get impatient.</p>

            <p>Most parents want their 9-13 year old children to learn the basics of saving and budgeting. 
              They also want their children to be able to differenciate between a want and a need so they can prioritize spending on needs before wants.</p>

              <p>Majority of the kids have their own devices and can access the platform with their own credentials, but we must still consider those who will be using their parent’s devices and will log in using their parent’s credentials.  We must have profiles  that will enable all kids to log in using their parent’s credentails and have their own data on their personalised profile.</p>

                <p>The majority are auditory and kinesthetic learners which means we must iclude some assignments where the parents help their children act out real life scenarios like borrowing a loan so that they can touch the money which favours kinesthetic learners and listen to what is being said.</p>

          <h3 class="subHeading">Recommendations</h4>
          <p>The <b>classes should be interactive</b> and include games and videos as their main medium of teaching the children because most children learn using visuals and touch.</p>
          <p><b>Parents should also be supported by creating educational resources for them</b> to learn about financial management too. They can have webinars and listen to investment talk about different investment plans they can venture into.</p>
          <p>The platform can <b>enable the child to set a goal for the day</b> like going through two videos about savings and once the goal is achieved the are rewarded with starts or bonus virtual money. </p>
          <p>The platform can also <b>have daily streaks to motivate the children</b> to visit the platform at least least once everyday.</p>
