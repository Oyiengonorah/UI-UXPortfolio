        <p>Building Early Money Habits in Kids. In the Bag provides age based, interactive money lessons for children 10 -12 years old (5th and 6th grade). It is a 5 week interactive live course taught online via Zoom where children learn about personal finance.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <h3 class="subHeading">Role and Collaboration</h3>
        <p>I was the only user researcher in this project. I had to figure out the pain points, the delights and the characteristics of our potential users which were parents and kids who were 9-13 years old. I also needed to go through existing products that were offering financial literacy to kids and find out wht can be improved.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="content">
        <h3 class="subHeading">Background</h3>
        <p>According to Forbes, 50% of children surveyed wish their parents taught them more about money. Children are not equipped with financial literacy and yet they are magically expected to be good at managing money when they are adults. They end up wasting money getting into debt which eventually affects their mental health and other aspects of their life.
        In the bag is a digital platform that will provide children with financial management resources that make break down the concepts to be easy to understand and fun to learn</p>

        <p>Back 2 School is a new product so I needed to understand the potential users more so that I know more about their frustrations and expectations then curate a product that suits them best. I decide to conduct user surveys using google forms and send them out to parents with children still going to school</p>
        <p>These are the questions asked:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Do you want your kids to go to a public or private school?</li>
          <li>Did the school meet your expectations?</li>
          <li>What are some common thinking styles parents demonstrate when making a school choice?</li>
          <li>How much time do parents typically spend researching different schools? How many schools do they consider before making a choice?</li>
          <li>What would parents change about the school choice process?</li>
        </ol>

        <h3 class="subHeading">Exploring Solutions</h3>
        <p>After conducting the survey we found out that most parents liked the fact that they could read reviews of other parents, it gave the digital platform a better user experience.</p>
        <p>We also realised that some parents didnt necesarily want to book atour for every scholl they were interested in, sometimes they just wanted to call or message the school administration to find out more or clarify something they wer unsure of. We added a voice call and direct message feature at the top of the pages with the school content.</p>

      <div class="content">
        <p>A parents always has certain qualities that they look for in a school before they enroll their child there. They needed a filtering option so that they get the search results that they want to go through only which prevents them from going through other results and wasting their time. We added the filter and sort feature near the search button.</p>

        <div class="content">
         <p>Parents also needed a reminder when they booked a tour online using the digital platform. Most of them forgot to manually set reminders and wanted the tour to be added to their calendars automatically when they finish booking a school tour.</p>

         <div class="content">
          <p>There is video section that allows the parents to interact with video content about the schools they are thinking of choosing. With the videos they are able to see what really happens on the ground and if what they say they have is actually there, They can also have virtual tours using the videos.</p>
